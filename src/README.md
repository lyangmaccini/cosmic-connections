## Context

Plug in you and somebody else's birthdays, find out your star signs, compatibility, and send them
an AI generated love letter through email!

## How to run

npm install
npm run dev
click on given host link
(this should work, but if not, maybe try setting java to version 17.0.8)
(also adding the activation-1.1.1.jar)

## Key designs

back end coded in java, front end in HTML/CSS/typescript.

## Inspiration

CS majors have a rep for being antisocial, but the truth is we are all hopeless romantics. When our
code can't give us answers about the universe, and bugs feel too heavy to carry, we look to the sky
for explanations. We wanted to create a safe space for dreaming. A place for all of our non-career
aspirations to shine. In the vast universe, there's one constant that we have, and it's each other.
Is your love written in the stars? Find out through Cosmic Connection!

## What it does

Plug in you and your partner/crush/enemy-to-lover/friend's birthday, and find out your star signs.
Then find out how compatible your signs are. Lastly, email an AI generated personalized love letter
to your match made in heaven (perfect in time for Valentines Day!)

## How we built it

We calculated the 78 combinations of star signs to find each compatibility. We used the Open-AI API
to access the prompt-to-text model to generate a love letter personalized to the person, and emailed
it to them using the javax.mail library. We built this project using java and OpenAI. We made our
website using HTML, CSS, and React.

## Challenges we ran into

All four of us are first time hackers so it was a challenging process navigating full stack
development and working as a team in a short period of time to create a large project. All of us
came into this project with very different skillsets so it was challenging but rewarding to puzzle
together all of our abilities. As someone who had extremely limited front-end experience prior to
this, I definitely wasn't the most helpful, and it wasn't the smoothest process ever. But we powered
through it, especially with the help of our talented designer Audrey <3 It was also challenging
figuring out how to use extensions of java we weren't familiar with, as well as connecting the
backend to our website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Figuring out how to use super cool java libraries and extensions to create more personalized user
experiences! We enjoyed the process of learning so many new aspects of full-stack, and pushing our
own knowledge to the limit.

## What we learned

Our knowledge and understanding of APIs grew, as well as web development. It was also a learning
process learning to bring our different backgrounds together for a product that we were all excited
and passionate about.

## What's next for Cosmic Connection

In the whimsical realm of Cosmic Connection, the mischievous stars are hosting a celestial party,
ensuring that its user experience is getting an upgrade that even the constellations envy. Get ready
for a user journey like shooting stars piercing through the night sky! New features and a potential
app skirt the nearby galaxies.
